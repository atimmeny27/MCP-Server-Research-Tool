# MCP-Server-Research-Tool

A long-form research assistant tool powered by LLMs, designed to gather information from primary sources, podcasts, academic PDFs, textbooks, YouTube, and more. This tool simulates deep, realistic research and outputs structured markdown files containing both a detailed topic summary and source list.

## üöÄ Installation

To get started on macOS:

You will need a free API key from OpenAI, scroll to bottom if you don't have a dedicated one for this project. 

1. Open **Terminal** (`‚åò + Space`, type `Terminal`, hit Enter).
2. Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atimmeny27/MCP-Server-Research-Tool
cd MCP-Server-Research-Tool
chmod +x start.sh
```

3. The tool is now verified, anytime you wish to launch the program, enter

```bash
./start.sh
```

4. You can also launch the scripts manually with

```bash
python MCP_assistant.py "Topic Here"
```
then
```bash
MCP_DURATION=long python send_to_claude.py
```

5. Step 3 is just a script to automate 4, they accomplish the same thing.
6. If you want to add this as a desktop tool, you can copy the "start.sh" contents (```open -e start.sh```),
   then paste them into a shell script inside the apple automator app.


### üîë How to Get Your Free OpenAI API Key

To use this tool, you‚Äôll need a free API key from OpenRouter (or OpenAI / Anothropic but this one is free). Follow these steps:

1. Sign Up or Log In

[Go to https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://openrouter.ai/)
‚û°Ô∏è Create an account or log in with Google/GitHub.

2. Generate an API Key
	‚Ä¢	After logging in, click your profile icon ‚Üí ‚ÄúAPI Keys‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Click ‚ÄúCreate Key‚Äù and copy the resulting string (starts with sk-or-...)
	‚Ä¢	Save it somewhere safe

3. Set Up Your Key Locally

4. To permanently keep this key active
```bash
open -e ~/.zshrc 
```
5. Then paste ```export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here-starting-with-sk-"``` at the end of the file, and save it
6. Now paste ```source ~/.zshrc``` in your terminal or refresh the session.

7. If you plan on using other projects with API keys in terminal, you may want to do step 3 inside of a .env file in this root directory(```touch .env
  open -e .env```
paste here)

    
8. Enter your topic, and wait up to 2 minutes for the LLM to research using primary sources, podcasts, pdfs, textbooks, and academic materials.

9. If you see "", it means it's currently researching

10. Once it's done, you can scroll through in the terminal, or search for "whatever-your-search-was.md" in finder, this will pull up the notes as well as sources used.

11. I hope you find this helpful and a fun tool to learn with. To edit the research prompt, look around lines 18-220 in send_to_claude.py. It will be the long f-string where the intructions are sent to Claude.
